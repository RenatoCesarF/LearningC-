<p>
My first try to run Monogame and a C# program, It took 6 hours but I <br/> finaly get it running on VScode, and not in Visual Studio (that would took 8gb of space)
</p>

<br/>
Commands:

> dotnet new mgdesktopgl -o MyGame

> cd MyGame

> dotnet add package MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL --version 3.8.0.1641

> dotnet run Program.cs
